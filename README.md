# undercurrent: User Stories

**Elevator Pitch:** A social media platform that emphasizes photos rather than text posts. An individual user's profile page will display their posts in a grid-like style that will clearly depict their tone or mood based on their posts. Users can upload/create their own posts. on undercurrent, there is no emphasis on likes, followers, or shares, so users can focus more on the content that is uploaded.
